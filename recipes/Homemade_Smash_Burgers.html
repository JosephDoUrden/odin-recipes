    <h1>Homemade Smash Burgers</h1>
    <p>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges. Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20
        for best results, and make sure the meat is very cold. I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the
        kitchen. These grill up very fast because of the high heat, so make sure you have everything ready to go!
    </p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>4 6-inch squares parchment paper</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
        <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large
            cast
            iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it
            from
            smashing properly. Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking
            to
            the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty) and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch
            thickness
            using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down. You may also
            use
            the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. Using a
            bench
            scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with
            cheese.
            Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4
            stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Tips</h1>
    <p>
        If you only have one spatula, wrap your other hand in an old dish towel for protection, and use it to press down
        on the spatula with both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can make 4 (4 ounce) patties instead of 8 (2 ounce patties), but I prefer the thinner patties that have more
        crispy surface area.
    </p>
    <p>
        I buy American cheese freshly-sliced from the deli, but individually-wrapped slices will work too.
