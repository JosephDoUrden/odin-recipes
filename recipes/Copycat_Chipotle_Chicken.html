    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ounce dried chipotle chile pepper</li>
        <li>1 ounce dried ancho chile pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>½ red onion, cut into small chunks</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sea salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chipotle and ancho chile peppers in a shallow bowl; pour in water. Cover the bowl and let sit at room
            temperature until peppers are softened, 10 to 12 hours. Drain water and remove seeds from peppers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Blend chile peppers, red onion, garlic, sea salt, cumin, oregano, and black pepper in a blender until a
            coarse paste forms; add olive oil and blend until marinade is smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place chicken thighs between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with
            the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag and add marinade. Turn chicken several times to coat. Seal bag and
            marinate in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat an indoor grill with top and bottom plates for medium-high heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove chicken from the bag and discard marinade.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place chicken on the preheated grill, close the lid, and cook until no longer pink in the center and the
            juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
            165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut chicken into strips and serve warm.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Tips</h1>
    <p>
        If you do not have an indoor electric grill, wrap a paver brick in aluminum foil and place it on top of the
        chicken to keep it flat while cooking on an outdoor grill.
    </p>
    <p>Soak chile peppers in chicken broth instead of water, if desired.</p>
